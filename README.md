# Python

*In this README, I will share Python concepts through exercises from the book Learn Python the Hard Way. The exercises are designed to take you from a beginner level to an intermediate level, making it a journey of discovering what the Python programming language is all about.*

## exercise_1.py

**What is exercise_1.py ?**

- <File_name>.<file_extension> python source code file use the `.py` extension. These files contain the actual Python code and can be executed by the Python interpreter.

**What the best Practices in python file name?**

- Good:`data_visualization.py, user_authentication.py`
- Bad: `DataVis.py, auth.py`

**What the Print?**

- The print() is function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.

## exercise_2.py

**What is # ?**

- `#` is way to write a comment

**What is the comment?**

- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code

There's severl ways to writ a commnet in python script such

- Using Hash `#`
- Using `(''' hello ''' or """ hello """ or 'hello')`

## exercise_3.py

**Python Operators.**

- `+` Plus
- `-` Minus
- `/` Slash
- `*` asterisk
- `%` Percent
- `<` less-than
- `>` greater-than
- `<=` Less-than-equal
- `>=` greater-than-equal

## exercise_4.py

**Variables and Names.**

- A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

*There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:*

- Camel Case `myVariableName = "John"`
- Pascal Case `MyVariableName = "John"`
- Snake Case `my_variable_name = "John"`

## exercise_5.py

**String formatting.**

- String formatting is essential in python for creating dynamic and well-structuerd text by inserting values into strings.
- Tools of String Formatting
- F-string
- str.format()
- modulo operator(%)

````python
name = "A"
f"Hello , {name}"
````

## exercise_6.py

- Taking some input data and change it to retuern it back with diffrent value.
